# Thesis Templates for a PhD at the University of Leicester

This repository contains a couple of templates for PhD theses at the University of Leicester.

There are two folders, one for the `bookdown` template and one for `latex`.
Just clone/fork/download the repository and use the template you prefer (with a strong advise to use `bookdown`).

There is lots of code that is commented out (especially in `preamble.tex`, for both templates): some (if not _most_) of those are customisations I used for [my own thesis](https://leicester.figshare.com/articles/Multilevel_Modelling_of_Electronic_Health_Records/10333547/1).

If you have any questions, feel free to post an [issue](https://github.com/ellessenne/uol-thesis/issues) in this repo: I will try to help.
