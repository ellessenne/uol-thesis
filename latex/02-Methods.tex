%!TEX root = YEAR-SURNAME-N-PhD.tex

\chapter{Methods}\label{methods}

\section{Section}\label{methods-section}

You have syntax to link to pretty much anything in this document, see for instance Chapter \ref{intro} and Section \ref{methods-references}.

\section{References}\label{methods-references}

You can cite papers \cite{gasparini_2018}, books \cite{brent_1973}, and even combine multiple citations \cite{R, scopus}.

\section{Cool}\label{methods-cool}

Something cool:

\begin{verbatim}
%!TEX root = YEAR-SURNAME-N-PhD.tex
\end{verbatim}

By having this line at the beginning of the file for each chapter, \emph{most} compilers will know that they need to start from that main file!
